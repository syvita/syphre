# syphre
Syphre is Syvitaâ€™s custom-built cryptographic protocol. It attempts to standardise the cryptographic algorithms used in Syvirean projects. 

It replaces TLS (Transport Layer Security) for Syvirean projects and defines the algorithms used for cryptographic functions. It is natively used in the HYPRDRIIV protocol to secure its transport mechanism.
